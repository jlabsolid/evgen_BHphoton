== info ==

this directory contains the event geenrator for Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS) in electroproduction
It is actaully a event generator for Bethe_Heitler process which used for TCS estimation

The photonproduction of BH crossection is based on formula Eur.Phys.J.C23:675-689,2002
Then virtual photon flux is calculated by equivalent photon approximation (EPA) by using formula 3 of
http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/other/lpc-94-35.pdf 

events are generated eveenly within available Eg, Q2 and t phase space. the phase space factors is in output

== code ==

main generator code is GenTCS.cc which calls other code as lib

To compile
setup root env
make
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
./GenTCS.exe Eb(GeV) Eg_min(GeV) t_lim(GeV) Ep(GeV) l(cm) Nsim

choose Ep 0 and l for fixed target (jlab 12GeV)
choose Ep non-0 and l 0 for collider (EIC)

The output tree is in GenTCS.root

anaTCS.C can be used to analyze the output tree
As script, it's too slow.
compile it first, then run
in root
.L anaTCS.C+
anaTCS("GenTCS.root","SoLID")
