== info ==

this directory contains the event geenrator for Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS) in electroproduction
It is actaully a event generator for Bethe_Heitler process which used for TCS estimation

The photonproduction of BH crossection is based on formula Eur.Phys.J.C23:675-689,2002
Then virtual photon flux is calculated by equivalent photon approximation (EPA) by using formula 3 of
http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/other/lpc-94-35.pdf 

events are generated eveenly within available Eg, Q2 and t phase space. the phase space factors is in output

== code ==

main generator code is GenTCS.cc which calls other code as lib

To compile
setup root env
make
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
./GenTCS.exe Eb(GeV) Eg_min(GeV) Q2_max(GeV2) t_lim(GeV2) Ep(GeV) l(cm) Nsim

typical SoLID choice 
double Eb=11.,Eg_min=4.2,Q2_max=0.05,t_lim=3.2,Ep=0.,l=15;

Q'2 (InvM^2 of decayleptopn pair) is set in code as 4 to 9

choose Ep=0 and l=non-0 for fixed target (jlab 12GeV)
choose Ep=non-0 and l=0 for collider (EIC)

The output tree is in GenTCS.root

anaTCS.C can be used to analyze the output tree
It's too slow to run as script, better run as binary
in root
.x anaTCS.C+("GenTCS.root","SoLID")
change SoLID to CLAS12 or EIC for other 

root file with acceptance histogram is needed for anaTCS.C to work
